                <h1>Nathan Abney</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Nathan Abney, a co-founder of Costellae Studios. I am currently a sophomore at Miami University majoring in Software Engineering. In middle
                school, I learned that I like programming through a clunky app on the 3ds titled 'Petit Computer'. It wasn't a very good application, and I wouldn't
                recommend it to anybody trying to enter programming, but it inspired me to continue programming through high school, where my final project
                my junior year was to create a video game in javascript about my teacher at the time dodging falling hammers. All of this led me to the decision
                of becoming a Software Engineering Major. Where I'm at now, I'd love to get Costellae to a level where a younger audience will be inspired by what we do
                and create.</p>

                <h1>Mason Flannery</h1>
                <p>Hey! I'm Mason Flannery, a co-founder of Costellae Studios. Currently I'm a Junior at Miami University majoring in Computer Science. I grew up without a
		PC and internet - up until middle school the only access I had was my school's computer lab and a 2nd gen iPad. 
		Shortly after I got my own laptop, which was my 2nd year of high school, I started to learn Python and simple programming basics. 
		I quickly discovered that I enjoy programming and I started taking programming courses. There, I met Nathan, and the rest is history.
		Costellae is an opportunity for us to serve as an example to demonstrate that you don't need a nice computer, a lifetime of experience,
		and a huge studio to make something unique that you're proud of. </p>
